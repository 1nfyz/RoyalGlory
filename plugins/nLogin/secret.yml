# To ensure that communication between the proxy and the backend server is done in an encrypted way, nLogin creates a random secret key.
# If you leave the value below null, encryption will be disabled (useful for servers where the proxy is hosted on the same machine as the backend).
# To set it up, follow this tutorial: https://docs.nickuc.com/nlogin-proxy
